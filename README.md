# Website Refactoring

This project was created for the intents and purposes of practicing and developing key refactoring skills. We are tasked with refactoring a given code and improve on its properties. In this case we are given access to a website code in which we needed to improve the accessibility of it. This means that we need to clean up the code which includes both the HTML and css styling. Execution of this requires that we: <ul>
<li> Consolidate CSS selectors and properties
<li> Follow semantic HTML rulings and reduce the use of < div >
<li>Providing comments to clarify actions/or uses of a section/element

</ul>

The project is done through the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
